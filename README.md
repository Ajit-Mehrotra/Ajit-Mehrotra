## Hi there ðŸ‘‹I'm Ajit!

My first programming teacher was an ðŸš€ex-NASAðŸš€ employee  and she inspired me to get into coding &rarr; Now I'm working on coding an open-source financial planning application to give every American the insights they deserve! 

I'm currently on the look out for a role in fullstack web development, ideally in JavaScript (other languages aren't deal-breakers...I've worked with many). I'd especially love to work with a small, tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
