## Hi there, I'm Ajit! 👋

My first programming teacher was an 🚀ex-NASA🚀 employee  and she inspired me to get into coding &rarr; Now:
- 🖥️ Been coding for 5 years
- 🤞 Coding an open-source financial planning application to give every access to personalized financial advice 
- 🐻 I’m learning C# and Laravel at the moment

I'm currently on the look out for a role in fullstack web development, ideally in JavaScript (other languages aren't deal-breakers). I'd especially love to work with a small, tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
